# Spec - repository-quality-gates

> **Glossary:** [CONTEXT](./CONTEXT.md)
> **Reference module / docs / channels used:** `README.md`, `docs/architecture-map.md`,
> `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/features/README.md`, `package.json`, `.github/dependabot.yml`.

## 1. Context

Snake3D is moving from a pet project toward a stable browser-game MVP, but the
repository currently has only a production build and a long browser stability check as
formal gates. Contributors can make changes without a single deterministic command that
checks type safety, style, focused tests, and existing browser coverage before review.

This matters now because the roadmap names repository and verification foundation as
Milestone 0, and later gameplay work will be riskier if every change has to rediscover
which checks to run. A maintainer needs a consistent local and review-time signal before
the project adds mobile controls, restart flows, persistence, and release readiness work.

The committed approach is to define a small, repeatable gate set for source changes,
make the expected commands visible to contributors, and ensure pull requests run the
same aggregate verification that maintainers use locally.

Assumptions recorded during specify:

- Assumed size `S` because the work is expected to fit in a small sequence of focused
  changes, introduces no backend or data model, and may add verification configuration.
- Assumed route `quick` because the feature is repository-foundation work with no product
  runtime flow or schema change.
- Assumed no extra external research is needed because the roadmap already identifies the
  gap and the source tree shows the current command surface.

## 2. Goals

- Give every contributor one documented verification path before requesting review.
- Give every maintainer a pull-request signal that catches broken builds and deterministic
  quality regressions before manual review.
- Establish the first deterministic test layer so future engine-rule work can be tested
  without relying only on randomized browser play.

## 3. Non-goals

- Do not change Snake3D gameplay, rendering, controls, level balance, or player-facing UI;
  this feature is repository infrastructure.
- Do not add a backend, account system, database, deployment platform, or release monitor;
  those belong to later roadmap items.
- Do not replace the existing browser stability test; it remains a gate and can be
  hardened separately.
- Do not require a complete test suite for every existing engine rule in this feature;
  the goal is the initial reliable gate and seed coverage.

## 4. User stories

### US-01: Run local gates

**As a** Contributor
**I want** one documented command sequence for quality gates
**So that** I can check a change before asking for review

### US-02: See focused failures

**As a** Contributor
**I want** gate failures to point at the failing quality area
**So that** I can fix the first broken check without guessing

### US-03: Review with confidence

**As a** Maintainer
**I want** pull requests to run the same aggregate verification expected locally
**So that** review starts from a known source state

### US-04: Protect existing coverage

**As a** Reviewing agent
**I want** existing browser stability coverage to remain part of the completion gate
**So that** repository hardening does not weaken current gameplay protection

### US-05: Seed deterministic tests

**As a** Maintainer
**I want** at least one deterministic test layer available for isolated game or utility rules
**So that** future changes can be pinned with focused checks before broader browser tests

### US-06: Understand setup expectations

**As a** Contributor
**I want** clean-checkout setup and supported runtime expectations documented
**So that** local gate results are comparable across machines

## 5. Acceptance criteria

### AC-01 (US-01) - happy

**Given** a Contributor has a clean checkout with dependencies installed
**When** the Contributor follows the documented verification path
**Then** the repository runs the aggregate quality gates in the documented order and clearly
shows whether the change is ready for review

### AC-02 (US-02) - error

**Given** a Contributor introduces a type or style problem in source code
**When** the Contributor runs the aggregate quality gate
**Then** the gate stops with a clear failing quality area so the Contributor can fix that
problem before continuing

### AC-03 (US-03) - authorization

**Given** a Contributor opens a pull request from a branch that has not passed the required
quality gates
**When** the Maintainer reviews the pull-request readiness
**Then** the repository marks the change as not ready for merge until the required gates pass

### AC-04 (US-04) - domain invariant

**Given** the repository already relies on browser stability coverage as a completion
requirement
**When** repository quality gates are updated
**Then** the existing browser stability coverage remains part of the documented completion
gate unless a later approved feature explicitly changes that rule

### AC-05 (US-06) - cross-context

**Given** a Contributor prepares the project from a clean checkout
**When** the Contributor compares local setup instructions, runtime expectations, and quality
gate commands
**Then** those repository documents agree with each other so the Contributor does not receive
conflicting setup or verification guidance

### AC-06 (US-05) - happy

**Given** a Maintainer wants future engine-rule changes to be testable without launching the
full game
**When** this feature is complete
**Then** the repository includes an initial deterministic test layer with at least one passing
focused check and instructions for adding more checks

### AC-07 (US-03) - error

**Given** the aggregate quality gate fails during pull-request verification
**When** a Maintainer views the pull-request readiness signal
**Then** the failing result is visible before manual approval so the Maintainer can request a
fix instead of merging an unverified change

## 6. Non-functional requirements

| Aspect | Target | Measurement |
|---|---:|---|
| Local deterministic gate runtime | <= 60 seconds on a warmed developer machine | Contributor timing from the aggregate gate excluding browser stability coverage |
| Aggregate gate clarity | 100% of configured checks have a documented purpose and failure owner | README quality-gate section review |
| Pull-request verification parity | 100% of required local aggregate checks run in pull-request verification | Maintainer review of pull-request gate configuration |
| Clean checkout setup | <= 3 commands before a Contributor can run the documented gates | README setup review from a fresh clone |
| Browser stability preservation | 100% of existing browser stability checks remain runnable from the documented gate set | Completion checklist review |

## 6.1 Security / privacy

- **Data classification:** public; the feature changes repository commands and review signals,
  not player data.
- **Personal data touched:** none.
- **AuthZ/AuthN impact:** no product authorization changes; pull-request readiness is enforced
  through repository review policy rather than game runtime permissions.
- **Abuse cases:**
  - Bypassed verification: Maintainer treats an unverified pull request as not ready until the
    required gates pass.
  - Misleading local result: Contributor follows documentation that names both deterministic
    gates and browser stability coverage.
  - Configuration drift: Reviewing agent checks that local documentation and pull-request
    verification describe the same required gate set.
- **Security review:** N/A because no runtime data, player identity, or permission boundary is
  introduced.

## 7. Metrics / KPIs

- **Aggregate gate adoption** - baseline: 0 aggregate commands; target: 1 documented aggregate
  command used for every feature implementation within 7 days of merge.
- **Pull-request gate coverage** - baseline: 0 pull-request verification workflows for the
  aggregate gate; target: 1 required pull-request workflow before the next gameplay feature is
  shipped.
- **Deterministic test foundation** - baseline: 0 unit-test commands; target: at least 1
  deterministic test command and 1 passing focused check in this feature.
- **Documentation agreement** - baseline: roadmap and README name future gates while the command
  surface does not; target: README, package commands, and pull-request verification agree before
  implementation review.
